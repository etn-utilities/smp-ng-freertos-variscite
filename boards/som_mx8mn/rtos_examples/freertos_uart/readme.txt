Overview
========
The UART example for FreeRTOS demonstrates the possibility to use the UART driver in the RTOS.
The example uses single instance of UART IP and writes string into, then reads back chars.
After every 4B received, these are sent back on UART.

Toolchain supported
===================
- IAR embedded Workbench  9.32.1
- GCC ARM Embedded  10.3.1

Hardware requirements
=====================
- Micro USB cable
- VAR-SOM-MX8M-NANO SoM
- J-Link Debug Probe
- proper power supply
- Personal Computer

Board settings
==============
No special settings are required.



Prepare the Demo
================
1.  Connect proper power supply and J-Link Debug Probe to the board, switch SW7 to power on the board
2.  Connect a proper cable between the host PC and the J18 header, (pins UART3 TX, RX and GND) on the target board.
3.  Open a serial terminal with the following settings:
    - 115200 baud rate
    - 8 data bits
    - No parity
    - One stop bit
    - No flow control
4.  Download the program to the target board.
5.  Launch the debugger in your IDE to begin running the demo.

Running the demo
================
You will see the welcome string printed out on the console.
You can send characters to the console back and they will be printed out onto console in a group of 4 characters.
